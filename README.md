Javascript form validator

This javascript plugin is written in jQuery.

It simply helps with validating form elements once the elements loose focus and also on form submission.

To validate a form element, add the class name "chk" to it. This is the minimum form of validation possible, which just ensure the form element isn't blank.

By adding the class names listed below some more specific data type and form element can be validated.
  "email"         - Email address field
  "date"          - Date field (with or without a datepicker)
  "dropdown"      - HTML select form element
  "phone number"  - Phone number field
  "image"         - JPEG, BMP, PNG image file input
  "docFile"       - PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XSLX, PPT, PPTX document file input
